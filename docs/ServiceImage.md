# ServiceImage

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ui_role** | **str** |  | [optional] 
**replaces_name** | **bool** | Generally only applies to &#x60;Image&#x60;s with &#x60;ui_role&#x60; of &#x60;service&#x60;. When present and &#x60;true&#x60;, this indicates that this image can be displayed instead of the &#x60;Service&#x60;&#x27;s &#x60;name&#x60;, as the image contains enough information to identify the service unambiguously. This is often the case with metro services, where the image would depict the number or color of the metro line, and displaying both the image and the name could appear redundant.  | [optional] [default to False]
